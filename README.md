STEP-4: Restart the System
A simple restart can often fix minor glitches and improve system performance.

STEP-5: Check Hardware If it's a hardware-related issue, ensure that all hardware components are properly connected and functioning. Look for loose cables, overheating, or hardware failures.

STEP-12: Update Drivers Ensure that your hardware drivers (graphics, sound, network) are up to date. Outdated drivers can cause various problems.


STEP-13: Restore the System If applicable, consider using system restore points to revert your system to a previous state when it was working correctly.
